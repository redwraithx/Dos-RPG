# Dos-RPG
this is a console based dnd like game.

Started from a tutorial that i have long forgotten the name of but if someone knows the source I would gladly credit them for setting me on my journey to becoming a programmer.

WARNING: this game is old school based and is very unforgiving mostly at the start, so prepare to have to restart a few times at the very least.
